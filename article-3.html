            <h1>Global Climate Pact Reached: 190 Countries Agree on Emissions Targets</h1>

            <p>PARIS – In a move hailed as "a triumph for multilateralism," delegates from over 190 countries have agreed on an ambitious new framework to accelerate the global transition away from fossil fuels. The pact, reached after two weeks of tense negotiations, sets binding targets for emissions reductions and financial aid for developing nations.</p>

            <p>The cornerstone of the agreement is the "30x30" pledge, committing signatory nations to generate 30% of their energy from renewable sources by 2030. Furthermore, a new fund has been established to help vulnerable countries rebuild after climate-related disasters.</p>

            <h3>Unprecedented Cooperation</h3>
            <p>"This is the most significant environmental agreement since the Paris Accord," said the UN Secretary-General. "For the first time, we see a unified global commitment with concrete, enforceable mechanisms. It sends a powerful message to markets and policymakers worldwide."</p>

            <p>While critics argue the targets are not aggressive enough, the overwhelming consensus is that this agreement marks a critical turning point in the world's fight against climate change, setting a new course for the rest of the century.</p>

    With over half of the world‚Äôs population now living in cities, the demand for sustainable urban planning has never
    been greater. The cities of the future are being designed with eco-friendly transportation, renewable energy,
    and green architecture at their core.
  </p>
  <p>
    Innovations such as vertical gardens, solar-panel skyscrapers, and AI-managed energy grids are reshaping urban
    landscapes. Planners are also focusing on pedestrian-first designs to reduce car dependency, improving air quality
    while fostering healthier lifestyles.
  </p>
  <p>
    From Singapore‚Äôs smart city initiatives to Copenhagen‚Äôs carbon-neutral goals, cities around the globe are becoming
    testbeds for sustainability. These advances are not only reducing emissions but also improving quality of life,
    setting the blueprint for a greener future.

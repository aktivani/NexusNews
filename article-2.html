            <h1>Sustainable Cities of the Future: How Urban Planning is Changing</h1>
            <p class="article-meta"><strong>By:</strong> Marcus Chen | <strong>Category:</strong> <a href="categories.html#science">Science</a> | <strong>Published:</strong> August 15, 2025</p>
            <img src="images/article-2-thumb.jpg" alt="A futuristic sustainable city with green buildings" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1rem 0;">

            <p>As global urbanization continues at an unprecedented rate, cities around the world are reimagining what urban living can look like. The sustainable city of the future isn't a distant dream—it's being built today in projects from Singapore to Stockholm.</p>

            <p>These cities integrate green technology, renewable energy, and innovative design to create environments that are not only eco-friendly but also more livable. Vertical forests, where buildings are covered in vegetation, help clean the air and regulate temperature. Rooftop solar panels and small wind turbines generate power locally, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

            <h3>Smart Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>Smart technology plays a crucial role in these future cities. IoT sensors monitor air quality, traffic flow, and energy usage in real-time, allowing for dynamic responses to urban challenges. Self-driving electric vehicles connected to a central traffic management system could reduce congestion and eliminate the need for parking spaces.</p>

            <p>Perhaps most importantly, these cities are designed with people in mind. Pedestrian-friendly zones, extensive cycling networks, and abundant green spaces encourage healthier lifestyles and stronger communities. The sustainable city isn't just about technology—it's about creating a higher quality of life for all residents.</p>
